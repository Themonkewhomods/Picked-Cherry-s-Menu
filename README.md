# Picked-Cherry-s-Menu
This is a mod menu for when other mods are down, not up-to-date, or just if you're new to modding. This is also a menu made in my spare time, so please don't expect much.

RULES:

1. DO NOT USE IN PUBS, OR YOU MAY/WILL GET BANNED!
2. Please be kind with these mods! I don't want you to be responsible for people crying.
3. Please don't copy this menu's code and claim it as yours! I worked really hard on this. (2 months)
4. If you get reported and banned, I am not responsible for it.
5. Be a good Monke, and have fun!
